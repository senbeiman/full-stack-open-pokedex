# Would this setup be better in a self-hosted or a cloud-based environment?
I think this setup would be better in a cloud-based environment.
Because this project is just for exercise and kept small.
The configuration of the cloud-based environment is simple and better to study the basis of CI/CD.
When we start to work with real projects, we shoud consider whether it is better to use a self-hosted environment.
